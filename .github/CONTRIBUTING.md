We respect the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) as we also use `commitlint` and 
precommit hooks to check the right syntax

We also use `lint-staged` to run eslint against staged files

- Clone this repository
- Enable [Corepack](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack) using `corepack enable`

## IDE

We recommend using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Volar](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar) to get the best experience (You might want to disable Vetur if you have it).
